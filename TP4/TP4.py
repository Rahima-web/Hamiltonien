PROBLEM : You look for a parking space on the street. Each space is free with probability p = 1 âˆ’ q. 
You cannot tell if a space is free until you reach it. You can not go backward. Once at a space, 
you must decide to stop or to continue. 
From position s (i.e., s spaces from your destination), the cost of stopping is s. 
The cost of passing your destination without parking is D. Construct the strategy
that will return the optimal parking space for a destination.

Note: Fix yourself (at your will) the values that you need to solve the problem
